# Introduction

fiskaltrust offers Compliance-as-a-Service for POS-Systems in the fiscalization area. This is done by using the license-free fiskaltrust software product "fiskaltrust.Middleware", which is integrated by the PosCreator into his POS-System. 

The fiskaltrust.Middleware takes care of the communication with the TSE and prepares the fiscalization data for the POS-System, which must be printed on the receipt (e.g. receipt number, signatures, start times, QR code for the audit, etc.). Furthermore, an export of audit-relevant data can be performed via the fiskaltrust.Middleware, locally at the PosOperator. These exports are provided by the fiskaltrust.Middleware in the formats defined by the legislator (DSFinV-K, TSE-TAR files). 

The fiskaltrust.Middleware runs as an independent service on the cash register of the PosOperator and must therefore be rolled out there by the PosDealer.

Furthermore, fiskaltrust offers add-on products (based on the fiskaltrust.Middleware) as well as individual products (independent of the fiskaltrust.Middleware) for PosOperators. These products are sold and rolled out to PosOperators exclusively through our PosDealer partners. These products include archiving products, automated reports to the tax office, technical security equipment (TSE) from various manufacturers as well as fiskaltrust.CarefreeBundles with and without a TSE-as-a-Service.

### The different roles of the fiskaltrust partners

At fiskaltrust, a basic distinction is made between three partner roles: PosCreator, PosDealer and PosOperator.

This documentation is intended for our partners who are PosCreators and/or PosDealers. Accordingly, it is divided into the following two sections:

- [Documentation for PosCreators](./poscreators/README.md)

- [Documentation for PosDealers](./posdealers/README.md)
