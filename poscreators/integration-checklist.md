# Integration Checklist
Integrating the Middleware involves several steps, from calling the API the right way to registering in the production Portal and connecting to Dealers. To simplify this process for POS Creators, we've composed a concise checklist that can be used to validate if all required steps were succesfully performed.

| Country | Check | Description | Docs |
| :----: | ----- | ----------- | --------- |
| ![All markets](images/flag-eu.png) | **Sandbox Portal account created** | An account in the sandbox Portal was created to create test Middleware instances. | [Getting Started Guide](README.md) |
| ![All markets](images/flag-eu.png) | **Production Portal account created & partner contract signed** | An account in the production Portal was created to manage POS Systems, and the PosCreator partner contract was signed. | [Getting Started Guide](README.md) |
| ![All markets](images/flag-eu.png) | **API methods are implemented** | The POS System can call the Middleware's API via the protocol of choice | [Function structures](https://docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/docs/poscreators/middleware-doc/general/function-structures) & <br /> [Communication protocols](https://docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/docs/poscreators/middleware-doc/general/communication) |
| ![All markets](images/flag-eu.png) | **Business sequences are implemented** | The required business cases (i.e. the `ftReceiptCases`, `ftChargeItemCases` and `ftPayItemCases`) are implemented. Depending on the POS system, not all cases might be required (only those which make sense for your use case). | [Receipt cases](https://docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/docs/poscreators/middleware-doc/general/reference-tables) & relevant country-specific appendices |
| ![All markets](images/flag-eu.png) | **Receipt headers are included** | The correct values are passed for `ftCashBoxID`, `ftPosSystemID`, `cbTerminalID`, `cbReceiptReference` and `cbReceiptMoment`. | [Data structures](https://docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/docs/poscreators/middleware-doc/general/data-structures) & relevant country-specific appendices |
| ![All markets](images/flag-eu.png) | **Special receipts are implemented** | Initial operation, zero, daily-, monthly- and yearly-closing, out of operation and other special receipts are implemented (country-specific mandatory) via the respective Â´ftReceiptCases`. | [Receipt cases](https://docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/docs/poscreators/middleware-doc/general/reference-tables) & relevant country-specific appendices |
| ![All markets](images/flag-eu.png) | **Error handling is implemented** | The different types of errors (Middleware not reachable & signing device/service not reachable) are properly handled by the POS software | [Cash register integration](https://docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/docs/poscreators/middleware-doc/general/cash-register-integration) & relevant country-specific appendices |
| ![All markets](images/flag-eu.png) | **Signatures are printed onto the physical receipts** | The `ftSignatureItems` returned by the Middleware are properly printed onto the physical receipts. Please note that generally all items need to printed, with some exceptions in Germany (more details available in the linked docs). | [Reference tables](https://docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/docs/poscreators/middleware-doc/general/reference-tables#type-of-signature-ftsignaturetype) & relevant country-specific appendices |
| ![All markets](images/flag-eu.png) | **POS Systems are created in the production Portal** | One POS System per model (not per actual device) is created in the Portal, and its ID is used as `ftPosSystemID` in sign requests. | [Getting Started Guide](README.md) |
| ![All markets](images/flag-eu.png) | **POS Dealers are invited and connected to POS Systems** | The POS Dealers distributing the device are either invited by their POS Creator or created their accounts themselves, and are connected to the previously created POS System. | [Getting Started Guide](README.md) |
| ![France](images/flag-fr.png) | **Certification or Attestation is done** | Either the certification (if the POS system is sold to third parties) or the attestation (if the POS system is developed for own use) has successfully been finished. | [Contact our experts](mailto:contact@fiskaltrust.fr) |
| ![All markets](images/flag-eu.png) | **_(Optional):_ Correct usage of business cases is approved by tax consultant** | A tax consultant who is familiar with the business sequences that are implemented via the Middleware approves the correct usage of _receipt-_, _charge item-_ and _pay item cases_. | [Getting Started Guide](README.md) |
| ![Germany](images/flag-de.png) | **_(Optional):_ DSFinV-K export is approved by tax consultant** | A tax consultant who is familiar with the business sequences that are implemented via the Middleware approves the content of a sample or live-data DSFinV-K export created via the Middleware or the Portal (Please note that structural integrity is [already certified](https://fiskaltrust.de/fiskaltrust-middleware-dsfinv-k-schnittstelle-jetzt-gobd-zertifiziert/)). | [Getting Started Guide](README.md) |
